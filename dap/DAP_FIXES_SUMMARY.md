# DAP Server Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Console.log with Multiple Arguments ✅
**Problem**: Console.log was using Go variadic function which doesn't work properly with Goja.

**Solution**: Changed to use `goja.FunctionCall` to properly handle JavaScript function calls.
- Modified in `adapter.go` lines 284-305
- Modified in `gojs.go` lines 113-130

### 2. Nested Object/Array Inspection ✅
**Problem**: Couldn't expand objects and arrays in the variable inspector.

**Solution**: Added `getObjectProperties` function to handle nested object inspection.
- New function at lines 577-650 in `adapter.go`
- Updated `handleVariables` to dispatch to proper handler

### 3. Breakpoint ID Mismatch Warning ✅
**Problem**: Goja was reporting incorrect breakpoint line numbers.

**Solution**: Added better logging and verification when setting breakpoints.
- Enhanced breakpoint verification in `handleSetBreakpoints`
- Improved error messages in `debugHandler`

### 4. Variable Scopes Organization ✅
**Problem**: Only showing one "Local" scope, mixing global and local variables.

**Solution**: Now shows separate "Local" and "Global" scopes.
- Modified `handleScopes` to add Global scope for top-level frames
- Updated `handleVariables` to handle scope references properly

## Remaining Limitations

### Local Variables in Functions ⚠️
**Issue**: Cannot show local variables or function parameters when paused inside a function.

**Reason**: The Goja debugger API doesn't expose local scopes or the scope chain.

**Workaround**: 
1. Use the Debug Console to evaluate variables while paused
2. The debugger now shows a note explaining this limitation
3. Shows `this` and tries to show `arguments` when available

**What's Needed**: The Goja runtime would need to be modified to expose:
- Local variable scopes for each stack frame
- Function parameters
- Closure variables

## Testing Instructions

1. Build the server:
   ```bash
   cd dap
   go build -o gojs .
   ```

2. Run in debug mode:
   ```bash
   ./gojs -d -f script.js
   ```

3. In VS Code:
   - Set breakpoints
   - Launch debugger
   - Check console output works with multiple arguments
   - Inspect variables (global variables and objects work, local variables show limitation note)

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added extensive logging for debugging DAP protocol issues
- Better error handling and validation
- Clearer separation between global and local scopes
- Documentation of limitations
