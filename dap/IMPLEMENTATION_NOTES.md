# Implementation Notes

## Current Status

The DAP implementation is functional but needs some refinements:

### What Works:
1. ✅ Normal execution mode: `./gojs script.js`
2. ✅ DAP protocol implementation with all core messages
3. ✅ VS Code extension structure
4. ✅ Build system

### What Needs Fixing:
1. ❌ Debug mode initialization - the VM is not properly initialized when starting from gojs
2. ❌ Variable inspection needs to be connected to actual Goja runtime state
3. ❌ Breakpoint handling needs proper integration with file paths

## Architecture Issues

The current implementation has a circular dependency issue:
- `gojs -d` starts a DAP server
- The DAP server needs to receive a "launch" request to initialize the VM
- But `gojs -d` is trying to pre-initialize everything

## Recommended Fix

The proper architecture should be:

1. **Option A: Pure DAP Mode**
   - `gojs -d` should ONLY start the DAP server
   - VS Code sends the launch request with the script path
   - The DAP server creates the VM and runs the script

2. **Option B: Attach Mode**
   - `gojs -d script.js` runs the script with a debug server
   - VS Code attaches to the running process
   - This requires keeping the script paused at start

## Quick Fix for Testing

To test the current implementation:

1. Start the DAP server directly:
   ```bash
   go run . -port 5678
   ```

2. In VS Code, use the launch configuration to connect

## Production Implementation

For a production-ready implementation, you would need:

1. **Proper Variable Inspection**: Hook into Goja's scope chain
2. **Accurate Breakpoints**: Map source positions correctly
3. **Full DAP Compliance**: Implement all optional features
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of all edge cases

## Testing Without VS Code

You can test the DAP server using a DAP client library or by sending raw DAP messages over TCP.
